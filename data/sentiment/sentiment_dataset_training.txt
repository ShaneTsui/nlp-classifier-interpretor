__label__NEGATIVE this place is an absolute joke !  i don ' t even know how this lady "nina" has a shop .  her work is very poor quality ,  she is rude and does nothing but
__label__NEGATIVE the  food  is  not  good  ,  but  the  music  is  nice   , and  the  service  is  fine . 
__label__POSITIVE this is definitely one of my favourite spots for szechuan food .  prices are a little toward the high side ,  but the food and impeccable service are totally worth it . 
__label__NEGATIVE first time ordering food from marco ' s .  we decided to do take out to test it out .  ordered the margarita pizza and baked ziti with meat sauce . the pizza dough was soggy
__label__NEGATIVE 220 dollar meal ,  and the entre was inedible .  i sent it back .  yes ,  they told me i didn ' t need to pay for it - but that ' s not remotely the point . 
__label__NEGATIVE i ' m a little torn .  i had high hopes for this place .  the building is really cute and they ' ve done a beautiful job on the inside .  it ' s looks like a really
__label__NEGATIVE one of the most unprofessional einsteins i ' ve been to by far !  staff ignored me for a good 5 mins ,  the girl who took my order seemed bothered to do her
__label__NEGATIVE hooter ' s was priced well but i would pay $10 or $20 more a night for anything better .  they also did not tell me about the resort fee when the room
__label__POSITIVE i went by their shop the other day because something felt weird with what i thought was my transmission .  i had called and josh said they were quite busy but

__label__NEGATIVE how disappointing .  i had my reservations with the economic price and bad reviews on yelp but thought we ' d give it a shot .  disappointed .  this really brings the sls image down . 
__label__POSITIVE solid fast mexican food .   enchiladas ,  nachos ,  and rolled tacos are good .   will try more stuff later . 
__label__NEGATIVE food was okay ,  but horrible service !  our waitress barely came around & gave us attitude when we were ordering .  i think tawny was her name ?

__label__POSITIVE had a great time racing ,  all had fun !  2 teens and 2 adults .  had a terrific time .  free shuttle pick up .  ;- ) 
__label__NEGATIVE extremely mediocre food that is not worth the price .   two drinks ,  a sandwich ,  and a burger ran us $80 ,  which i would be fine with if it were great
__label__NEGATIVE it wasn ' t bad but it wasn ' t the greatest either .  shrimp taco had 4 pieces of shrimp and all lettuce .  the burritos are huge and you get a lot of food

__label__NEGATIVE well i would love to tell you if the food was good or bad ,  but i did not get the chance .   i arrived at re tapas at 9:00 on
__label__NEGATIVE the food was okay this was our second time there but it was overshadowed by the horrible horrible service we were left without drinks for an unbelievably long time then
__label__NEGATIVE no bueno !  !   the guy who took my order over the phone was unprofessional & said our food would be ready in 5min .   we didn ' t believe him so we

__label__NEGATIVE agree with the previous reviewer that this home purchasing process was the most stressful ,  horrible experience and that was all because of wilson parker homes and their agents .  their sales

__label__POSITIVE great steakhouse with wood and leather decor with art deco stained glass chandeliers .  wait staff is attentive without being obtrusive .  a half pound of crab legs was plenty for me ,

__label__NEGATIVE ye ' s sushi is the worst japanese resurant in canada !  even the service is bad too .  i  strongly recommend we dont go to ye ' s . i am gonna try other sushi rsturant
__label__NEGATIVE i went here with two other friends for dinner ,  but it was nothing from what we expected . first of all ,  this restaurant could use some redecoration ,  and the atmosphere didn ' t made
__label__NEGATIVE i was disappointed .  the ratings and reviews on yelp raised my expectations for this place .  if you ' re a local i can see the appeal .  great wait staff ,  personalized service ,  and
__label__NEGATIVE stingray is everything that is wrong with sushi in america .  this place is just for young ,  dumb pretty things ,  and the douchebags that hunt them ,  to go for a quick
__label__NEGATIVE heaven forbid you don ' t smoke and would like to enjoy your food in the bar area and have a beer .  for a california chain ,  the experience is nothing like "non
__label__NEGATIVE beware of pick pocketers !  !  !  !  !  !  ! in terms of the club itself ,  i ' d give it 5 stars .  i loved the energy and my girls and i were having a great time partying at
__label__POSITIVE i will most definitely be going back to this neat little spot .   i actually feel bad that they don ' t have a better location for themselves as i think they
__label__POSITIVE came here for the first time today for lunch with my parents and i was very pleased .  it was a little busy when we got there ,  but we were still
__label__POSITIVE love the club .  tennis is great .  people are great and it ' s a very social atmosphere .  one downside is on the weekends it can get crowded and difficult to find a
__label__POSITIVE first of all it is about expectations .  if you want to stay in a five star hotel it will be nicer ,  but be prepared to pay the extra bucks .  the
__label__NEGATIVE if your going to ra ,  i would recommend choosing another location .  i frequently visit the awahtukee spot ,  which is really great ,  and this chain let me down .  not only did
__label__POSITIVE delicious ,  always my go to place for delicious ,  non-greasy chinese food in madison ! 
__label__NEGATIVE horrible service .  just awful .  five to-go orders came in after us ,  ordered ,  and got there food before the waitress even put our order in .  the place wasn ' t even busy .  we
__label__NEGATIVE went here a couple weeks ago and really enjoyed it .  we had a good lunch at a reasonable price .  the beer selection is olid  ( gotta love gumball head )  and the
__label__POSITIVE yum great coffee great friendly staff and great location .  i love the friendly community atmosphere .  love the yoda too it has kale in it
__label__POSITIVE i had a bit of difficulty finding the place .  no big signs saying the business name .  check in process was okay .  they use this tablet / ipad for the process ,  yes it ' s
__label__POSITIVE good selection .  enjoyed walking around here while the rest of our group was off golfing . 
__label__NEGATIVE we went to the bacchanal buffet yesterday to celebrate my birthday .   we have eaten thee about 6 times last year  ( june thru october 2013 )  and after getting shut out
__label__POSITIVE this restaurant offers something for everyone .  you can order a hamburger or a full meal .  mexican salad is delicious ,  prime rib sandwich is excellent ,  everything i have had is great . 
__label__NEGATIVE i succumbed to peer pressure ! don ' t you hate it when you don ' t trust your own instincts ?   ok ,  so yelp is a great resource and so are friends '  recommendations .   but
__label__NEGATIVE why didn ' t i check the reviews first ?  instead ,  i just picked the first shuttle company that was there .  incompetent and rude ,  to boot ! the ride from the airport to the convention
__label__POSITIVE fabulous spring training /  st .  patrick ' s day /  birthday weekend !  i personally loved everything about this hotel .  the location is unbeatable - walking distance from everything you can imagine doing in scottsdale . 
__label__NEGATIVE i went to this restaurant expecting a positive experience ,  but ended with a terrible one .  first and foremost ,  the wine is incredibly overpriced .  some of the nicer restaurants in uptown
__label__NEGATIVE i would hate for you to order food late at your local fox and hounds in huntersville . 
__label__POSITIVE adele is fantastic !  lovely person ,  lovely stylist ,  lovely work .  salon is eclectic chic and clean ,  and the music is always intriguing .  she ' s the first person i ' ve let cut my hair
__label__POSITIVE a friend dragged me to this place on friday at 3 in the morning .  that ' s literally what it took to get me there because he promised there will be pan
__label__POSITIVE i used to make fun of the notion of a business renting space to sell $3 popsicles ,  but betty has won me over .   her paletas are legit .   her
__label__POSITIVE great place to chill !  features local art .  .  .  eco friendly .  .  .  tsoynami is equal to a dq blizzard .  .  .  but no animals were harmed !  and the soft serve soy ice cream is home
__label__NEGATIVE i have been there twice now ,  didn ' t want to write a bad review based on 1 visit ,  especially since they just opened .    but after today definitely won ' t go
__label__NEGATIVE sushi is ok .  kabuki is better ,  they just are .  go try it .  i ' m trying to keep this short but i ' m not writing out a long enough review ,  maybe if i
__label__NEGATIVE from the street ,  my husband and i thought zoe ' s kitchen would be like panera - that is ,  we thought it would serve fast ,  flavorful ,  and good-quality lunch fare .  none of
__label__POSITIVE great tom khah soup !  !  relatively cheap lunch special .  staff is great ,  however the decor is missing .  it needs some personality ! 
__label__POSITIVE awesome !  the peach bellini here is quite good .  the only think i ' m not happy with is that when they give you extra shots ,  it comes in upside down test tubes
__label__NEGATIVE do not stay here !  !  !  !  i don ' t care if you ' re broke as hell ,  sleep in your car !  this place was such a dump .  they tried to charge an early check in
__label__NEGATIVE no fresh ingredients at all .  mushrooms are obviously canned .  how someone could rate a burger place high that doesn ' t do cook to order burgers is ridiculous .  might as well go
__label__POSITIVE this is a great park for the fitness enthusiast .   with stairs ,  hills ,  basketball court ,   baseball field ,  jungle gym and a loop for walking or running it really is
__label__POSITIVE the jet room is a must when in madison .  watching planes take off and land while eating the best diner breakfast or lunch in madison is a huge hit with
__label__POSITIVE we really enjoyed our experience .  britney our server was knowledgeable  and very friendly .  not sure if it was the owner or manager that stopped by our table to ask
__label__NEGATIVE the food is ok !  i feel like they use poor quality ingredients .  the feta cheese used for salads and omlets is not high quality .  the salad dressing is all olives
__label__NEGATIVE paella was over seasoned .  staff was so rude staring with the hostess and the waitress .  price was good .  but i won ' t come back . 
__label__NEGATIVE wow ,  really ?  order shots from the girl with the test tube shots but they charge for four extra ? only correct after i do the math for her ?  really ?  you are selling
__label__POSITIVE another excellent dinner in our new city my wife and i tried their seasonal tasting menu which was excellent service was impeccable restaurant was beautiful
__label__NEGATIVE we went there on a sat night at 6:15 and it was half empty and i now understand why .  the food was average .  the brussel sprouts that everyone raves about
__label__NEGATIVE i do like supporting small local businesses but i will never go back to this store .   i agree with jez r  their customer service is really bad .  i
__label__NEGATIVE the best part about this restaurant was the unique setting .   it is a quasi-outdoor warehouse with casual seating areas  ( apart from the restaurant seating )  and outdoor games .   aside
__label__POSITIVE because thomas keller in little doses never disappoints . oddly enough ,  im was disappointed at the size of their cupcakes .  it was too big ,  too american ,  too tacky for the food that
__label__NEGATIVE when i was a wee chan ,  i visited the sahara several times with my parents .   even then ,  i recognized it was a bit dated from the rest of the
__label__NEGATIVE i actually liked coming here until the "2nd in command" here came at me like a dick !  he even clowned me for lifting what i was lifting .  i ' m trying to
__label__POSITIVE love this place !  use to come here all the time after school  ,  conveniently located right next to unlv .  their meats are good everything tastes fresh suggest ordering the mix
__label__NEGATIVE this week i stopped into the courier cafe for the first time .   we were grabbing a late lunch ,  which was probably a mistake .   i ignored my intuition that
__label__NEGATIVE left the office in tears and was extremely discouraged .  dr .  behara came highly recommended ,  so my fiance '  and i decided to go to her .  i really wanted to try to
__label__NEGATIVE horrible money hungry girls .  so many that you never have a chance to breath .  many of them are fat !  crazy horse 3 is better ! 
__label__POSITIVE great place to stay in scottsdale ! close to the heart of old town ,  & fabulously located near the best of shopping & eateries !  love the comfort ,  quality & sophistication of the
__label__NEGATIVE nothing was false and to update the pentair factory rep came out and fixed gentry mistake as of yesterday    he was very nice and helpful
__label__POSITIVE this was one of the most pleasant shopping experiences i ' ve had since being pregnant .  the service clerk was soo friendly and helped me find the perfect outfit for my baby
__label__POSITIVE i look forward to the wranglers games for 10 reasons .  .  . 1 )  it ' s in an expensive night out that ' s easy to find / get in and out of2 )  a fight breaks out every now
__label__NEGATIVE if you ' re going here for "tea" good luck .  not much more than flavoring syrup and hot water .  if you want a real cup of tea walk down to tea infusion . 
__label__POSITIVE yum !   we don ' t have mexican food like this in eugene ,  oregon .  being a so cal native i have missed good quality mexican .   the chips they serve are fresh
__label__POSITIVE first time at this waffles .  i usually drop into the one on fort apache and trop but was meeting a friend for lunch .  ordered the usual: breakfast sandwich special with
__label__POSITIVE came here with a couple of the guys after looking for an authentic mexican restaurant in charlotte .  the staff didn ' t know much english but besides that everything was amazing . 
__label__NEGATIVE this place ' s name is deceiving !   it really should be called j&j msg cuisine .   i think their philosophy is "msg saves us the trouble of learning how to cook" . 
__label__NEGATIVE worst service i ' ve ever had .  i ' ve had my nails on for 9 years now and never had a problem .  came on vacation last min and needed a fill so i
__label__POSITIVE it ' s definitely cheap compared to other hotels in dt phoenix .   we weren ' t in the hotel much anyway because we were traveling . as with any hotel - you get what you
__label__NEGATIVE went with a friend after we had a craving for some wings .   soon as we walk in ,  we noticed an empty dinning area and after a few moments noticed
__label__POSITIVE had the pho with the brisket it was delicious and my son had the chicken noodle soup which he devoured perfect for a cold and rainy day ,  they were pretty
__label__POSITIVE bacon ,  people !   spicy italian sausages ,  brats ,  even heirloom veggies by the pound ?   locally raised hogs and none of the extra chemicals the corporations and grocery stores use ? 
__label__POSITIVE i ' ve been coming here to kau kau  for a long time  .  dennis and his wife are awesome people .  it feels like home  ( hawaii  )   .  that ' s why i
__label__NEGATIVE this place is terrible and that saddens me because it is only a mile from my house .  i do go in for a quick lip wax from time to time
__label__NEGATIVE wait time was very nice ,  only 15 min for a party of 8 .  we went on a sunday evening for dinner .  our server was nice but was very forgetful ,  she
__label__POSITIVE i went here for lunch ,  got the black bean veggie burger and side salad .   it was delicious .   i would definitely go back . 
__label__POSITIVE this place rocks !   i drive from la to get my passat serviced - all of them are great and reliable and fair .   i have not found a better
__label__NEGATIVE this review has nothing to do with the food .  this is entirely with the service on 7 / 24 / 2012 at around 12:30 .  i called in to place an order over the phone
__label__POSITIVE the associates at this store are very friendly and helpful .  from the moment i walked in at the door to when i checked out i was greeted and it was
__label__POSITIVE this place is awesome .  owner is from laos .  food is authentic and flavorful .  we had 2 of the curries and the soup and it was amazing .  price is  reasonable . 
__label__POSITIVE the best breakfast place by far .  i never even liked breakfast food until trying their eggs and french toast . 
__label__NEGATIVE i was so excited that crab corner opened on rainbow and sunset .  i took my friend there for a belated birthday lunch as she is from maryland and loves good
__label__POSITIVE always quality and fresh .  i ' ve even come in to buy french bread for spagetti at my house .  the white bread is buttery and the egg salad .  .  .  . to die for ! 
__label__POSITIVE bk vape n smoke is my go to shop ,  it ' s manager / owner "amar singh" has the coolest attitude and is easy to have a conversation with .  i like how it ' s only
__label__POSITIVE this has to have been the one "perfect" experience with dining that my girlfriend and i have had in las vegas on this trip .  the service was very prompt and
__label__POSITIVE determined to find a sweet joint with cheep booze ,  husband got to searching .  we were headed to a bar in scottsdale ,  but then he read about shady ' s .  his bff with
__label__NEGATIVE we went here while we were in vegas because we had seen it on bar rescue .  we were literally the only people in the whole place .  the atmosphere and decor
__label__NEGATIVE used to be awesome ,  new website is horrible for special orders ,  keg selection on hand has dropped significantly & prices for a 1 / 2 keg of anything mildly interesting have all
__label__POSITIVE so there ' s this burger joint in a block house with metal bar windows ,  a gravel parking lot and it sits adjacent to a railroad yard .  there ' s a standing room only
__label__POSITIVE after all these years ,  how did i not know you could buy chocolate cake by weight ?   best thing ever !   we did this a few weeks ago and it
__label__NEGATIVE i ' m not sure what all the hype is about with these cupcakes .  .  . my daughter wanted cupcakes for graduation since we just moved here and we weren ' t going to have a big

__label__POSITIVE this is a great shop !   they are honest ,  thorough and also timely .   i have been bringing my car to them for the past three years ,  and they are
__label__POSITIVE wings ,  spicy ,  asparagus awesome ,  corned beef eggroll awesome .  let me tell you ,  that asparagus was insanely good a slight heart attack but insanely good so i will mandate that you

__label__POSITIVE consistent quality .   that ' s it !   we can come here for a meal any time and we know what we ' re going to get every time !   they have a good
__label__POSITIVE new burger placed call johnnys burgers & dogs is opening up in this location .  similar menu ,  i ' ll have to check it out ! 
__label__NEGATIVE so very unfortunate that mccarran airport has such lackluster food options .  ruby ' s has the feel of a johnny rockets that has had all of the fun ,  cleanliness ,  and spirit beaten
__label__POSITIVE i came here with a huge party of about 20 and was seated outside .  it was a nice and warm night too ,  which was great .  we ordered several salads which
__label__POSITIVE cooookiiiieeeees .   i am a sucker for the standard penut butter cookie ,  and i often wonder how many different ways i can be dissatisfied by each new place i try .  .  .

__label__NEGATIVE this egg works has been a breakfast go-to for the gf and i for sometime .   we usually go at least once a month .   this latest visit has us
__label__POSITIVE best buffet i ' ve ever had .  food was great .  many different choices to choose from .  great atmosphere and decor .  the staff was friendly and efficient .  a bit pricy but well worth
__label__NEGATIVE after a 4 . 5 drive in from az for a much needed little get away with my fiancee .  we had booked our rooms for the flamingo week and half ago and
__label__POSITIVE wonderful food and location !  i loved that this place was away from tourists ,  but still easy to access ,  just a block down from fremont street .  we actually had lunch here
__label__NEGATIVE i had this expectation that coming to vegas for the first time would be insane--lavish ,  excessive ,  probably a bit trashy ,  and highly inebriated .  it has definitely been that last one , 
__label__POSITIVE i was rear ended in a car accident and needed to get checked .  i always review yelp for new situations and found express urgent care .  everyone i encountered there was
__label__NEGATIVE we ordered room service ,  3 pizzas ,  under $60 .   very thin crust ,  and not crisp at all ,  very doughy .   my sister loved hers ,  but maybe it ' s because she hadn ' t
__label__NEGATIVE okay ,  first let me say i have given this place several chances and every time i leave pissed off .  one of the first times i went in this place ,  it
__label__NEGATIVE more than 11 dollars for one beer and one diet coke ,  and this was supposed to be happy hour .  and that was before the tip .  which i now regret giving . 
__label__NEGATIVE going out of business !  ?  for good ?  or to reopen after restructuring ?  ?  ?   .  .  .  no wonder the service was absolutely horrible when i was there in february 2012 .  we were redecorating our

__label__NEGATIVE luxor is a mediocre hotel .  you get what you pay for .  the price might almost be reasonable if it wasn ' t for resort fees .  registration took forever but the room was
__label__POSITIVE delicious & great service !  something for everyone .  i ' m really white and invariably end up with some california roll variation wherever i go .   my companion was very asian & had
__label__NEGATIVE as divey as it gets .  it ' s smokey ,  locals abound ,  and there are some characters .  if you ' re looking for cheap beer and happen to be downtown ,  stop in ,  but bring your

__label__NEGATIVE awful service .  they make you buy a 2 hour pass but the bus takes close to 10min at each stop and often doesn ' t let you get on because it is
__label__NEGATIVE if it weren ' t for yelp making me give it at least 1 star ,  this place would get zero ,  that ' s right ,  zero stars .   i have had one bad experience after
__label__POSITIVE i ' m always rooting for coffee shops that aren ' t starbucks .   i would rather put my money into keeping quaint shops with a friendly staff in business .   jolta ' s joltacchino ' s are

__label__POSITIVE solid place .   good beer selection and a small brewery allows for some in-house beers that aren ' t bad on their own .   i ' ll stop by next time i ' m in town . 
__label__POSITIVE excellent atmosphere for a margarita and some yummy tacos .  right across the street from the wynn and encore ,  this place is an easy stop on your way out of town .

__label__POSITIVE this place is a hidden gem in the desert .  the food is amazing ,  the prices are reasonable for the amount and quality of the food you receive .  my only complaint
__label__NEGATIVE i thought crossroads farm lessons were good enough until i went to a different stable .  the group lessons are not very effective and the tack is not in good shape .

__label__NEGATIVE if you are looking for a place to live- this is not it !  i have never been treated so horribly by a management company in all of my years of

__label__NEGATIVE awful service ,  servers rushing you to order ,  impatient answering questions ,  unfriendly attitude ,  made us feel unwelcome .  the coffee glass was stained with some white particles ,  and they reassured us these
__label__NEGATIVE i was concerned as to who selected the venue ,  and what city official inspected it .  .  .  there was absolutely no handicap access beyond the lobby .  are there not regulations and laws

__label__NEGATIVE the number listed is someone ' s private number and has no connection to this place .  someone needs to update their number !  !  ! 
__label__NEGATIVE beware this place is a ripoff ,  they add extra items on your bill after they do the job .   imagine being charged $24 for having tires shipped from their own

__label__POSITIVE flo ' s is the bomb-diggity .  my family has known flo since she was the cook at eddie chan ' s in scottsdale .  i loved that little hole in the wall chinese restaurant and

__label__NEGATIVE in a city with nail salons on every corner ,  customer service is essential .  being the newest ,  "nicest" salon isn ' t enough .  had the worst experience here with my son - the
__label__POSITIVE fun course ,  well kept .  nice views .   me and my husband live on the course so we frequently play here .  the service mostly good and welcoming .  way over priced in

__label__POSITIVE this restaurant nearly killed me in the best ,  most delicious way possible .  my companion and i came here for the arizona restaurant week deal and it was not a mistake . 
__label__NEGATIVE never again .  .  . drove the six miles in there only to find out there is no doctor on duty .  what a waste of time .  sure i could have called but when i
__label__NEGATIVE stay away from this restaurant .  the quality is awful .  all frozen seafood .  and the waitress brought us the wrong food .  after we had a bite of the roll ,  they took
__label__POSITIVE ah ,  dunkin '  donuts .   how i love that you sprout up everywhere . this one especially has a very well-spaced interior ,  many many outlets for all your techies and comfy chairs in
__label__NEGATIVE underwhelming selection of draft beers for a beer garden .   decent burger .   tablemate ordered a can of beer .   it arrived after his food .   had this been march

__label__POSITIVE they have great food options !   their bread is phenomenal ,  but i love their salads most of all .   and their gluten free pizza crust is the best i have
__label__NEGATIVE i ' ve now been to this location 3 times .   i had previously visited the locations and really enjoyed my meals . unfortunately ,  something seems to be missing here at the "downtown" location . the
__label__NEGATIVE i wish i had looked this place up on yelp before i played here .  first i checked to see if they would have any cart restrictions for the weekend i
__label__NEGATIVE it ' s too bad that there isn ' t an opportunity here to give minus stars .   my wife and i stayed one night at this hotel because the rate included parking while
__label__NEGATIVE while the service was above average the food was so-so .  i ordered the new york strip and it was grisly with little flavor . 
__label__POSITIVE stumbled in here one night while i was in town on business and i ' m sure glad i did !  free sangria if i check in ?  ok sure why not ,  it was
__label__POSITIVE great multigrain sandwiches .  nice patio too ! 
__label__NEGATIVE oscar ' s opened several years ago with a good helping of razzle ,  dazzle and sizzle .  when entering the restaurant ,  the experience was much like entering a different era ,  politically incorrect and
__label__NEGATIVE i have stayed here on and off at the end of august and beginning sept waiting for my house to close .   i paid the rate they asked except i
__label__NEGATIVE o m g .  i need to update this one fur-shure .  it had been a few month ' s since having something from here .  what the heck happened ?  i soooooo *proudly* wrote the

__label__NEGATIVE not the best .  wanted to try this place .  used to go to the one down town phx .  toasted ravs were great .  got a loaf of bread that was wonderful .  i
__label__NEGATIVE trying out this new location and not impressed at all .  with my new schedule ,  this facility is more convenient with it being off the 215 . pf philosophy was to promote a
__label__NEGATIVE once we got seated our server brittni was right over and took our drink order .   came back to take our food order once drinks came out .   but never
__label__NEGATIVE i will say that the food was okay ,  however when it comes to service ,  it was a disaster !  after ordering our food ,  it took 37 min to get ,  never got
__label__NEGATIVE please read this before attending !  !  !  ! i want to start off by saying that going into this show i was some what optimistic in seeing some traditional dancing with acrobatics mixed into
__label__NEGATIVE dirty !  this place cannot be sanitary .  the staff was arguing .  it was not a pleasant experience at all .  go somewhere that is clean and where you can feel comfortable . 
__label__NEGATIVE i think i got someone new because my manicure was just awful .  the nails were ridged like they weren ' t filed properly and were not even painted fully .  the woman only
__label__NEGATIVE my husband and i went to sushi 101 on a tuesday evening .  we met up with a group of people of approximately 8 people .  the staff was able to easily
__label__NEGATIVE once again .  order delivered wrong .  who ' s the fool now .  ok .  .  . i ' ll quit ordering from there .  smh
__label__NEGATIVE worst service ever ,  just came in to get my nail fixed and they told me its 43$ and they have to do all my nails over .   but then told
__label__NEGATIVE pricy for the kind and selection of food that they have .  they don ' t even have seaweed salad .   i ' d rather go to asian buffet or makino next time .   the
__label__POSITIVE just have to say best place i have stayed in vegas .  in the last year and a half i have stayed other hotels and this place offers the most for
__label__NEGATIVE for what it is ,  it ' s fine .   it is birthday party hell all the time .   but i ' m not a fan of kids parties and unsupervised children running my kid
__label__POSITIVE wax is waxing center that also offers the basics of a spa .   they offer basic facials and a line of premium organic skincare products .   the staff is quite
__label__NEGATIVE now i love chipotle .  .  .  . i ' ve been to many indifferent states and i ' ve always gotten consistently good food i can always rely on .   so when i thought i try a new
__label__POSITIVE this place is awesome !  so much food !  a little pricey ,  but it ' s quality .  food is fresh with normal sized servings .  lots of drinks to choose from !  you really feel comfy

__label__POSITIVE great bar in old town to watch a game .   drinks are good and cheap .   i didn ' t get a chance to eat but will go back for the food , 
__label__POSITIVE took my car in here before going on a road trip .  the mechanic looked at it ,  filled my fluids up for free ,  and gave me an honest assessment of the
__label__POSITIVE my first time to the double door was 1974 ,  they were expanding what is now the back game room . i ' ve been back time and again over the years for many different
__label__POSITIVE kris is absolutely wonderful !   most painless brazilian i have ever gotten and i even forgot to take advil beforehand !   she was great to talk to and also has
__label__NEGATIVE the money factory !  !   clearly this place prints money for the doctors and don ' t you dare get in the way .   doctor was okay - clearly too busy counting his
__label__POSITIVE aguas frescas is why i give this place 5 stars !   the best in the valley ,  try the jugo de verde  ( with lime ,  pineapple ,  cactus )  and horchata and cantaloupe if
__label__NEGATIVE been here twice and the doors were closed .  uhhh ?  ?  ?  put a sign on your door if you ' re closed ! 
__label__POSITIVE i would like to preface my review with a little background on me .  i was born in phoenix 33 years ago .  over the years i have tried hundreds  ( if not

__label__POSITIVE great service .  definitely recommend thad ,  very professional and knows what he is doing ,  and didn ' t break the bank . 
__label__POSITIVE cupcakes are ruling my world right now .   summer is coming up ,  i need to stop soon .  but in the meanwhile ,  i am making a strong effort to taste as
__label__NEGATIVE we went to this place this evening to redeem a yelp "$10 for $5" deal .  i ' m not sure how they manage to keep a stellar rating .  it was good food , 
__label__NEGATIVE maggiano ' s little italy  .  .  .  epic fail last night ! ok ,  so last night  ( 10 / 2 / 13 )  we returned to maggiano ' s little italy restaurant in the fashion show center ,  on the vegas strip ,  expecting our
__label__POSITIVE great coffee ,  vibe ,  and food .  terrible parking ,  take the light rail if you can ! 
__label__NEGATIVE this is another of of those ,  "if it wasn ' t for the convenient location ,  i doubt it would exist" kind of places .  of course the location i ' m referring to is about
__label__POSITIVE i was referred to mt repair by coworkers .  i have an  ' 01 beetle ,  and finding an affordable ,  knowledgeable shop has been tricky-until now .   these guys take great care of
__label__NEGATIVE beware: hotel security guard  ( most-likely )  stole my wallet / cash . i stayed here with a group of friends a few weeks back and had a great time: nice rooms ,  fun atmosphere ,  really friendly
__label__POSITIVE this review is for 11 / 13 / 2010 .   i lost majority of my receipts and i managed to just get this out of my bag .  as many of you know ,  i am
__label__POSITIVE pretty good food .  nice wine selection ,  little pricy .  for being the only place open late on a sunday night ,  they did very well . the appetizers we great .  got fried calamari and
__label__NEGATIVE food was horrible !  i ordered a burrito and it was blander than calcium pills !  service was annoying !  they kept coming to our table every min to ask if everything was
__label__POSITIVE always love barro ' s but this is my first time to this location .  on top of the great food ,  excellent service ,  and sports bar atmosphere without the bar ,  they have a
__label__NEGATIVE skip this coaster it ' s horrible and just hurts you all around ! the view you get of the new york new york from the coaster is super cool but that ' s really about
__label__NEGATIVE very beautiful !  was such a gorgeous place the view was a widescreen hd version of pittsburgh point with the ducky in the river at the time i went .  there was
__label__NEGATIVE this is the weirdest bar i ' ve ever been to ,  and i don ' t mean that in a good way .  at first ,  the hideaway looked promising ,  with a neon sign directing us
__label__NEGATIVE another chain restaurant that purports to be mexican but is not .  the food is also very mediocre . 
__label__NEGATIVE was not impressed . this restaurant is located in a trendy shopping plaza ,  surrounded by trendy and boutique stores .   i should not have been surprised by the dining experience but i
__label__POSITIVE we ' ve been going to on the border for over 15 years and love monterey ranch chicken fajitas . i just wish they would bring back the ultimate loaded queso .  they will make
__label__NEGATIVE firefly offered $11 per day on expedia . com .  i rented the smallest car for 4 days and it gave me approximate total of $84 . 39 .  my flight arrived in vegas at 12
__label__POSITIVE in love with this place !  best ceviche and empanadas in town .  you feel welcome and at home ,  the staff is warm and careful ,  highly recommended . 
__label__NEGATIVE burnt ,  bitter espresso .  bitterly disappointing .  this place has so much potential ,  the pasties look yummy .  i ordered my usual ,  an iced triple soy latte ,  to jolt me awake and fend
__label__POSITIVE the 4th star is for the fact that they ' re open 24hrs and im usually a fan of eateries open 24hrs .  apparently ,  this is an extension of the cheesecake factory .  it
__label__POSITIVE i love this place all the way from the velvet wallpaper ,  chandlers and hardwood floors ,  to the delicious prosciutto and ice cold beer . there is only two reasons the roosevelt doesn ' t
__label__NEGATIVE they were okay with the ceremony however their photography ,  follow up is terrible .  they gave us certificates for another couple when we were there .   i did not notice until
__label__NEGATIVE run of the mill stuff when compared to other standard buffets in vegas .  multiple options to choose from - mid eastern ,  italian ,  american ,  mexican ,  sea food ,  desserts ,  salad and soup
__label__NEGATIVE the foods is pretty ok not great but average at least for the waffles .    the chicken always seems to be dry and tough and has almost no flavor . 
__label__POSITIVE still lovin that new york steamer .    can ' t review anything else on the menu since i am stuck on that hot and savory pastrami and brisket sub .   if
__label__NEGATIVE it is very difficult for me to admit that a steakhouse is bad ,  but this one wins .  we stayed for 2 hours and they only served 2 types of meat
__label__NEGATIVE jose quoted me a price for a yard cleanup ,  replacing side yard grass with rocks ,  and laying sod in the back yard .   when they showed up to work ,  he
__label__NEGATIVE i ' ve been to hooters all over florida and this was the worst it could be .  the staff was great ,  the place was new .  but the wings ,  were horrible soaked in
__label__NEGATIVE if i could give it zero stars i would .  we took a tour of the facilities and all i could think of was how can we get these people out
__label__POSITIVE a big group of friends and i went to kabob n kurry for my husbands birthday .  it was absolutely wonderful !  the staff was friendly and the food was delicious .  there
__label__NEGATIVE ugh ,  i ' ve kinda been dreading writing this review .  i came in here for lunch on a weekday .  i used to work in scottsdale ,  and my girlfriend worked in phoenix so
__label__POSITIVE awesome homemade ice cream .  much better quality than chains ,  and more reasonably priced .  so delicious and the flavors are really creative . 
__label__NEGATIVE let me preface this negative review by saying while on vacation ,  i ' m there for the scene and the sites ,  not the hotel  .  .  .  therefore ,  i ' m totally not a "hotel snob" . 
__label__POSITIVE love the pita jungle ,  close to home ,  great patio ,  and great food .  service is on point and when it ' s not they make it right .  great place for lunch or dinner
__label__NEGATIVE ew had a terrible experience here recently .  it looked really nice so i took a leap of faith and thought maybe they could do my eyebrows  ( new to that side
__label__NEGATIVE disgusting .  i can ' t believe i got stuck in a tourist trap in my own city .  just wanted to sit outside and have a steak .  wish i could say it was
__label__POSITIVE an extensive menu ,  something for everyone .  best breakfast anywhere near fountain hills .  i love the thursday potato soup !  9 tvs ,  no reason to miss your favorite team ' s game . 
__label__NEGATIVE this place is disappointing .  they needed up our order three times and was not willing to substitute items in our entree when they clearly told is they ran out of . 
__label__POSITIVE i ' ve been to coyote joe ' s a couple of times .  the place is massive with a wonderful dance floor and great instructors that teach a variety of line dances .  .  . something for both
__label__POSITIVE back for the second night in a row .  best tacos i ' ve had in a very long time .  very friendly service and excellent margaritas .  all priced right ! 
__label__NEGATIVE owie .  my belly hurt after eating here .  i was looking forward to steamed veggies ,  but they didn ' t have any .  said they were out .  total bummer .  so ,  i ate some shrimp
__label__NEGATIVE my husband and i were at the palazzo ,  bar and restaurant hopping ,  trying new places .   we were also gambling and walking the casino floor .   i ' ve never noticed zine
__label__NEGATIVE this one seems a bit more crowded than the location on eastern ,  but that also means the selection is quite large .  it ' s often impossible to find the same item in
__label__NEGATIVE even with a groupon coupon ,  for the prices they charge ,  my money would have been better spent elsewhere .  i had higher expectations for spitfire grill & tavern .  the best thing , 
__label__NEGATIVE guy who did my nails did a horrible job .  they looked awful .  he seemed to be in a hurry and it showed .  definitely the worst full set i ' ve ever had . 
__label__NEGATIVE i called to make an appointment to fix a leaky spigot .  left a voicemail  ( no outgoing message )  ,  and have not received a repsonse 24 hours later .  i understand this is
__label__NEGATIVE i read reviews prior to renting from dollar ,  and thought to myself that it can ' t be that bad and these ppl just had bad experiences .  hoping for better i went
__label__NEGATIVE jade noodles resides on the casino level of the palazzo hotel .  the decor was in a dark red contemporary ambiance . i was looking forward to their  ' remarkable '  dim sum dishes .  but
__label__POSITIVE i just love this place .   the bartenders are a lot of fun and their summer seasonal beer rocks .   the spicy chicken tenders are a must and the all
__label__POSITIVE $1 mondays are most awesome !   checked out with 8 pieces of clothing w / tax+10% off related to their new loyalty program=$7 . 78= 90 cents / piece !   : )   fitting rooms available . 
__label__POSITIVE my boyfriend and i decided to stop in westgate for lunch today .  we were weary of the concept walking in !  we sat at the bar and our bartender was katie
__label__NEGATIVE i was invited theree last month and it hasnt changed .   much better places to eat ,  lousy parking ,  zero atmosphere ,  and too many grannies serving .   i far prefer more
__label__POSITIVE and who doesn ' t need a trip through the shoppes at the forum and an excuse to perhaps catch the statue show ? while i don ' t get the allure of eating a meal
__label__NEGATIVE stayed here for our wedding .  yes ,  it ' s nice ,  but just don ' t leave anything behind in the room worth of value .  we forgot a couple of items behind in the room
__label__NEGATIVE as soon as i entered i knew i should had taken into the account the reviews talking about the service .  not even a "hello ,  sit anywhere" nothing .  not even a
__label__NEGATIVE i cannot believe that the staff is so ridiculously rude at this location .  i have been to many whole foods markets and have always been struck with how dang friendly
__label__POSITIVE mac shack ,  mac shack ,  mac shack .  .  . you got me mackin '  over some pasta = )  if you ' re a pasta lover like myself ,  you will appreciate this place .  i love that it ' s located
__label__POSITIVE pretty awesome !  we got hooked up with drinks and the whole nine yards .  staff is awesome !  being with the right people makes the biggest difference .  .  . i was in and out of
__label__POSITIVE woke up craving acai berry bowl .  so glad jamba juice has it .  pulled up 2 the drive through was greeted immediately the guy working the window as pleasant .  we got
__label__POSITIVE get the assam tea .  .  . this was drink almost everyday for four years .   this place rocks . 
__label__POSITIVE great trail for those that want a fairly easy hike .  it ' s been pretty quiet every time i ' ve gone which is nice .  a few different paths with varying degrees of difficulty
__label__POSITIVE the bison burger is is absolutely delicious and the black and white shake is just short of addicting howeverthe bill will reach deep into your pocket book so it is
__label__POSITIVE definitely a must visit for ayce korean bbq in montreal .  tianxia has better quality and more variety of meat than other places like seoul chako .  for example ,  i find that
__label__POSITIVE so much to do here !  the casino ,  lounge w /  entertainment at night ,  club ,  restaurants ,  outdoor pool  ( not heated )  and a shopping center near by . i got a good deal on groupon
__label__NEGATIVE yikes !  where do i begin .  .  .  .  .  . well it started off with my mom deciding we should order food from here to pick up for dinner .  she called and ordered a large pizza:
__label__NEGATIVE its the worst hotel&casino we ' ve ever been !  !  just don ' t go there  !  !  !  the staff is very rude ,  casino rip everybody off  ,  you pay for everyday 23$ for pool and
__label__NEGATIVE i ' m somewhat shocked that this place averaged 3 1 / 2 stars .   coming from los angeles ,  i ' ve had my fair share of mexican food .   from the hole in the one
__label__POSITIVE was up in vegas all last week and a friend recommended this place for all you can eat sushi for about $26 and this place was probably one of the
__label__POSITIVE the great thing about this place is that it ' s brilliantly cheap ,  considering the quality and variety of tasty italian food on offer ,  with homemade pasta being the top marks ware
__label__NEGATIVE i ' m from la .  we went last week on friday  (  3 of us ,  after we picked our friend who ' s local )  around 2:00 pm .  we were seated immediately ,  put in our
__label__POSITIVE sandwich .  salad .  soup .  yum !  yum !  yum !  i noticed cafe zupas before they opened ,  looked it up online ,  and was excited to try something new in the area .  since then ,  i
__label__NEGATIVE mediocre ,  as far as mediterranean in vegas goes .  bf picked up takeout here after a trip to the courthouse across the street .  the gyro salad is fresh ,  but doesn ' t have
__label__NEGATIVE what a disappointing experience .  we sat at the bar with three bartenders and getting service was like pulling teeth .  they all just huddled around the registers instead of asking if
__label__NEGATIVE food took an hour to get to us .   then it was cold but we were too hungry to send it back and have them spit in it .   i
__label__NEGATIVE i take my car here every 3 , 000 miles for oil changes only .  these guys will try to sell you everything you don ' t need for your car so be careful !  i
__label__POSITIVE excellent service ,  bonne cuisine  ( bien que le canard soit un peu coriace ,  mais le filet mignon est incroyable !  )  .  clientèle un peu âgée ,  mais ça n ' enlève rien au restaurant .   si
__label__POSITIVE i ' m disappointed to have to report that dr thompson left the practice .   the staff has always been professional and courteous so i ' m sure this will continue to be an
__label__NEGATIVE sometimes the cashiers are rude ,  if i hand you my money don ' t slap down my change on the counter .  this one stock guy is so rude he practically yelled at
__label__POSITIVE one of the best buffets that i have been to in vegas .  not very crowded .  all of the food is very fresh .  they have salad ,  soup ,  american ,  french ,  mexican ,  asian , 
__label__POSITIVE really ?  i have never written a review for this place ?  wow !  yes i am giving it 5 solid stars .  every single time i have come  ( and i pray i don ' t
__label__POSITIVE so i ' m not really a coffee aficionado but i ' m a big fan of coffee shops and the different atmospheres in each .   simply put ,  big dog has just about the
__label__POSITIVE my girlfriend and i are always looking for a new place to try and after a quick internet search ,  decided on this place ,  which was close by .   we ' ve been
__label__POSITIVE this place is very cute ,  quaint ,  and homely .  good place to take the mom out to eat or the inlaws .  or your grandma .  lots of old ladies .  not exactly for
__label__POSITIVE good food ,  huge portions .  got a blueberry pancake plate and a waffle plate for 3 adults and one child .  more than enough food .  good tasting food ,  very friendly and attentive
__label__NEGATIVE fuck this place .  they will never receive another cent from me .  they have messed up my orders multiple times and i kept giving them chances .  tonight was the last one . 
__label__POSITIVE mike stell and his crew are top notch .   they are professional ,  courteous ,  hard-working and all-around nice guys .   after getting several quotes from different companies we chose stell roofing . 
__label__NEGATIVE dreadful food  (  have not tried their pizza )  .  the lemon chicken and the greek salad were tolerable ,  but the spaghetti and sauce ,  plus the chicken parmigiana ,  we ' re tasteless .  i would
__label__NEGATIVE i came tonight as i do often ,  there was 5 of us .  we got here at 5:30  ( eating with the old folks crowd )  and the hostess said it would be
__label__NEGATIVE how i expected more .  like waaaaay more .  went during memorial day weekend 2008 and it was my bf ' s  ( now fiance yay !  )  and my first trip to vegas together and since
__label__NEGATIVE i would give it 2 stars if it shouldn ' t of been as everyone raves "the place with the best pie in arizona . "  can you say over-rated ?   we had
__label__POSITIVE stellar service and very good food . we tried rolls and a sandwich .  .  .  next time we ' ll hit their noodles . 
__label__NEGATIVE there was a time in which risque was actually cool ,  but that time has long passed .   paris is not one of those properties that come to mind when people
__label__POSITIVE good food and service .  it is an absolutely horrible place to go if you are by yourself .  food is served family style ,  so take your sorry single self to a
__label__POSITIVE i have used them twice and both times i was astonished at the level of care for my things and their diligence in ensuring a smooth and stress free experience . 
__label__NEGATIVE i would give less than 1 star if yelp would let me .  this company has by far given me the worst customer service of my life .  when my cable company
__label__POSITIVE good fun place to watch games while drinking and eating chicken wings or sandwiches . they have a good selection of wings and decent beer .  i try different kinds of wings
__label__NEGATIVE sadly have to downgrade here .  .  .  . food is not as great as the first few times i went .  .  . and def not the best in town .  its a really nice place with nice ppl
__label__NEGATIVE cibo tries really hard to be a great little italian restaurant ,  but ultimately fails to do so on almost all counts .   my boyfriend and i made a 7:30 saturday
__label__POSITIVE i ' ve reviewed the other one before ,  but grand lux cafe  ( by the maker ' s of cheesecake factory )  never disappoints . they single handedly own some of the best  ( in the entire world ) : spaghetti
__label__POSITIVE i love smash burger .  my fav is the sincity burger . this location is awesome !  its close to home and the people are all friendly !  : )  : )  : ) 
__label__POSITIVE i love this place !  excellent customer service with skills !  i gave them the benefit of a doubt and was very impressed !   lindsey ,  i don ' t know what you ' re talking about . 
__label__NEGATIVE happy wok did not make me happy it actually ruined my day .  .  .  .  .  i waited 30 mins for the food and when it got to me totally tasted like the way
__label__NEGATIVE to celebrate a birthday ,  4 sisters ,  1 daughter and 1cousin spent 3 days at the hotel at mandalay bay this past weekend .   very disappointing ,  it ' s our second time at
__label__NEGATIVE cozy if you can get a seat in the back ,  if by the door you will freeze to death .  i wanted to like this place but it was by far
__label__NEGATIVE i walked in ,  looking for the section with the least beige plaid .  a quick tour around the room and even from ten feet away ,  i could tell they didn ' t have
__label__NEGATIVE just okay - seems to be a popular lunch place for folks working in the area .   the fries and potato salad were very good .   the sandwiches not so
__label__NEGATIVE well ,  for my first cirque de soliel show ,  this one pretty much sucked .   i expected more . the acrobatics were good and some of the stage settings were great .   however , 
__label__POSITIVE been here 3 times already so far so good .  no complains about food i just hope they add: bistek tagalog into their menu .  .  other than that i love to eat
__label__POSITIVE hands down one of my go to restaurants for pizza pies .   quality ingredients ,  cheese is not greasy like other pizza restaurants .    the taste of the crust is
__label__NEGATIVE i believe ,  the only reason why this place receives business is because people rather not wait for food at the ramen place across the plaza .  not great .  the thai tea
__label__NEGATIVE they are only open until 6pm contrary to the hours posted on here .  .  . thanks a lot for the drive : / 
__label__NEGATIVE worst service ever .   i ' ve never had any issue with getting a hot fudge with a love it .  .  .  even when i go to corporate in scottsdale they do it with
__label__POSITIVE how much can i say that i love one business .  .  .  i had the great luck of having my house flood .  .  anyone that has had to deal with the insurance company ' s
__label__NEGATIVE do not go here !  !  beware !  !  ! i decided to have my car towed there in distress after my front brakes locked on me while i was driving .  i had no choice being
__label__POSITIVE i just got take-out from ali baba .  we ordered a bunch of the a la carte items ,  and there was way too much food .  as a note ,  their website menu
__label__POSITIVE is it so wrong that i ' m digging; this hotel ?  i know it ' s virtually for a slightly more mature crowd ,  but it ' s small and straight to the point .  what i mean
__label__NEGATIVE ok so when you walk into this place once again a place in vegas that has cafe in their name yet is not café style whatsoever .  now their pizza ,  although
__label__NEGATIVE going into this place really teleports you to an east coast bar / pubunfortunetly the local customers are not what you expect to see in an east coast bar / pubno obvious cops shooting
__label__POSITIVE it ' s our first time and the only thing i didn ' t really like is the service .  no one even greeted us when we are waiting and the server even walked past
__label__NEGATIVE 6pm and the line was long like any in&out . the cashier was a beeeetch . when i told her "i have gluten allergy so .  .  .  ( yup thats where she cut me off ) " she told me
__label__NEGATIVE if you actually like good-tasting pizza  ( and you have standards )  ,  stay away .  i literally rank lil '  caesers above this place .  any chain restaurant ,  for that matter ,  has better pizza .  their
__label__NEGATIVE flashing neon signs say open ,  and it ' s lunchtime on mothers day ,  which seems like the best time for a massage place to be open .  but the doors are locked tight , 
__label__POSITIVE i love nello ' s !  !  !   my boyfriend and i have been going there for over a year now and have never had a bad experience !   we love the barbecue chicken

__label__NEGATIVE despite having mammoth sized portions ,  and well in my opinion overpriced kebab ,  they have the nerve to say "you cannot share" or "you must order an appetizer" ,  literally forcing you
__label__POSITIVE so ,  first of all i am rarely passionate about a restaurant nor am i combative to individuals that would differ from my opinion on yelp of all places .  though i

__label__NEGATIVE just ate lunch here today and while the food was ok--but tending toward flavorless--i thought the service was rather brusque .  also they charge you $1 for a slice of bread
__label__NEGATIVE this station gets points for being located in downtown vegas as opposed to the forlorn south strip terminal where megabus drops off .  but otherwise ,  it ' s your average soul-sucking greyhound craphole .

__label__POSITIVE great miso soup ,  the salad is also great .  the sushi is the best in the west valley . 
__label__POSITIVE this place definitely lives up to the hype ! first appearance is not what i expected .  it looked like some janky hole-in-the-wall spot from the outside .  but inside was a pleasant surprise . 
__label__NEGATIVE the food was good however i don ' t think i would eat here again .  1 .  the portions they give you is really small .  2 .  customer service sucked .  we asked for more

__label__NEGATIVE it might be fun as a club ,  but for dinner ,  eh .  from the description i thought that alain ducasse was the chef .  nope .  they just feature some of his dishes . 
__label__NEGATIVE i have to say that i had an excellent meal here last summer  ( 2007 )  ,  but since then chuch has failed to impress .  .  .  last meal was dry ,  tasted like ketchup ,  and
