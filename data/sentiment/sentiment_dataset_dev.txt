__label__NEGATIVE i went in for a gelcolor application ,  which is listed as being fifteen dollars .   i live nearby ,  so the price and location is why i originally tried this place
__label__NEGATIVE this place does not deserve not even one star .   as we open the door you are slapped with an odor of mugginess ,  mold ,  mildew ,  grease ,  humidity and stinky dirty
__label__POSITIVE it ' s a great burger .  .  . the stuff isn ' t cheap ,  but it ' s really tasty .  there are a variety of options ,  tons of toppings and options ,  a veggie burger  ( if you ' re into that sort

__label__POSITIVE best california rolls in the city .  always soft and top quality ingredients .  yes the lady is rude but maybe just try and look over the menu before you go so
__label__POSITIVE i love this place .  my wife and i stop and have breakfast after hiking .  dogs are allowed outside on the patio and they bring water bowls for them .  oh .  .  . and more

__label__POSITIVE best donuts in town .  i normally get a small black coffee and a buttermilk cake .  fresh coffee and donuts all the time ! 
__label__NEGATIVE please don ' t confuse "mekong plaza" with "mekong palace" . "mekong plaza" is one of the finest oriental shopping center in mesa  ( my opinion )  . "mekong palace" is a newly open chinese dim sum diner
